# Jupyter Notebook

This repository provides an introduction to using *NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn* in Jupyter Notebook for data analysis & visualization.  

## Libraries Used  

- *NumPy* - Numerical computing library for handling arrays & mathematical operations.  
- *Pandas* - Data manipulation and analysis library, especially for working with structured data (DataFrames).
- *Matplotlib* - Visualization library for creating static, animated, interactive plots.
- *Scikit-learn (sklearn)* - Powerful library for building & evaluating ML models in Py.
  - Preprocessing
  - Model Training
  - Evaluation
  - Validation

## Installation Lib. in Py

Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using:  

```bash
pip install --upgrade numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn seaborn
```

## Run on Jupyter Cells
